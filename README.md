# Purpose

This project is to clean and standardize datasets generated by Qiuping "Ellen" Peng during her PhD thesis work. Ellen used a program called SAGA to create a series of terrain attributes at each georeference point at both Cook East and Cook West fields. This project aims to put CookEast and CookWest files in the same format and to use standard variable names and values where appropriate.

Methods and and metadata of Ellen's work can be found on the cafltar Google Shared Drive.
